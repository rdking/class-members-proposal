# Object members proposal

## Goal

This proposal is to provide functional support for access modifiers on object memmbers, namely `private`, `protected`, & `public`, as well as a "private container access operator" (`#`) to ES. Support for `static` in conjunction with access modifiers is to be supported for function objects. The end result will be lexical declaration syntax for:

* Fully encapsulated, hard-private fields accessible from an object
* Soft-private fields accessible from an object or its descendants
* Static fields at any access level accessible from a function object

## Rationale
Adding access levels to ES will provide developers with a clear, direct, and easy to understand means of modeling objects and their APIs using an approach familiar from other languages. Basing this paradigm on objects allows the feature to be used in both handwritten object factories and classes. The following should be understood when reading this proposal:

* **`private`** - full encapsulation. Only accessible from declaring object's lexically included methods. Not an "ownProperty" of the object.
* **`protected`** - accessible via lexically included methods of the declaring object and its descendants. Not an "ownProperty" of the object.
* **`public`** - the default for any field added to any object.

The only reason `public` will be implemented is because unlike normal objects, a function's lexical scope (closure) is `private` by default. Declaring a public function having access to privileged fields on a function object without constantly re-declaring the function member requires that there be a means to do so lexically within the function closure that will only be processed once. Hence, `public` will be allowed for variable declarations within a function, but only when paired with `static`. Beyond this singular use case, `public` serves no purpose.

## Existing proposals
This proposal covers ground in ES for which there are already existing proposals, namely:
* [proposal-static-class-features](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-static-class-features/)
* [proposal-class-fields](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields)

This proposal should be considered as inheriting the intent and some of the design of these pre-existing proposals. However, there are several critical differences between this proposal and the pre-existing proposals. These differences, I hope, will help to improve both the understanding and adoption of these features without unduely encumbering the language's optimizability or future extensibility. In the two subsections below, the phrase "existing proposal" refers to the proposal named in the section header.

#### Compared to proposal-static-class-features...
This proposal has few problems of its own, but inherits several by being tied to proposal-class fields.

* The existing proposal lacks the ability to provide an equivalent of `static #field;` in a function. This limits what developers can do with factory functions. This increases the conplexity of creating a method on the factory constructor that has access to the private data of the factory-created object without constantly re-creating the function.

  * The `static` keyword will be made available within the lexical scope of a function in conjunction with the access modifiers. 

* The existing proposal, due to the lack of a `protected` equivalent in proposal-class fields, has no concept of a `protected static` declaration in the existing proposal.

  * The `protected` keyword will be made available within the lexical scope of all objects. Within a function, this is a means of declaring the inheritable data for a function. Within a function, it must be used in conjunction with the `static` keyword or a `SyntaxError` will occur. 

#### Compared to proposal-class-fields...
The sheer amount effort that has been put into the existing proposal is formidable. It would be ill-adivsed at best to ignore the amount of effort poured into it. However, the existing proposal is not without its issues.

* The syntax, while ostensibly easy to understand is meeting with high resistance from many of those who are aware of and interested in affecting the proposal. See [issue #100](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields/issues/100).

  * This proposal uses the well-known syntax and meanings for declaring fields with access levels making the learning curve small.
  * This proposal provides a single operator for accessing non-public fields. This keeps access simple, consistent, and as obvious as possible.

* Attempts to understand the syntax of the existing proposal leads to mental model conflicts that are inherent to the use of the syntax itself. See [the FAQ](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields/blob/master/PRIVATE_SYNTAX_FAQ.md#but-doesnt-giving-thisx-and-thisx-different-semantics-break-an-invariant-of-current-syntax), [issue #104](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields/issues/104#issuecomment-396623715), [issue #77](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields/issues/77#issuecomment-360974968).
  * Instead of using the sigil in a way that always has 2 of 3 different meanings (declaration token, access operator, `[[IdentifierName]]` character), it will instead be used only as an access operator.

* The syntax of the existing proposal limits the new features to `class` declarations despite ES being a prototype-based language as opposed to a class-based one. See [issue #77](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields/issues/77#issuecomment-361016935).

  * The access modifiers will be made available to object and function declarations.
  * The `#` access operator will be made available to functions declared within an object literal declaration.

* The existing proposal refuses to use the `private` keyword for fear that it "implies that access would be done with `this.x`" ([FAQ](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields/blob/master/PRIVATE_SYNTAX_FAQ.md#why-arent-declarations-private-x)). This is despite the fact that you can [model encapsulation using WeakMaps](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields/blob/master/PRIVATE_SYNTAX_FAQ.md#how-can-you-model-encapsulation-using-weakmaps), which also does not use a `this.x` notation.

  * Access modifier keywords will be used to define non-public fields.
  * Access notation will become `obj#.field` for non-public fields, maintaining some semblance of the `obj.field` expectation since `obj#` retrieves the private data record.

* The syntax of the existing proposal breaks the common equality `this.x === this['x']` for private fields due to the fact that the `#` sigil is part of the `[[IdentifierName]]` of the private field. See [the FAQ](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields/blob/master/PRIVATE_SYNTAX_FAQ.md#why-doesnt-thisx-access-the-private-field-named-x-given-that-thisx-does), [issue #74](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields/issues/74).

  * Computed field access has been restored such that `obj#.field === obj#['field']`.

* The existing proposal lacks any concept of `protected`, making it difficult to share API that must not be accessible from the own properties of an object. See [issue #86](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields/issues/86).

  * The `protected` keyword will be used to define a field that can be accessed by descendant `class` instances but is not an own property of the object.

## Notation
The new syntax should be as follows:
<pre>
  <i>FunctionScopeAccessModifier</i>:
    <b>public</b>
    <b>protected</b>
  <i>ObjectScopeAccessModifier</i>:
    <b>protected</b>
    <b>private</b>

    <i>MethodDefinition</i>
    <b>static</b> <i>MethodDefinition</i>
    <i>ObjectScopeAccessModifier</i> <i>MethodDefinition</i>
    <i>ObjectScopeAccessModifier</i> <b>static</b> <i>MethodDefinition</i>

    <i>ObjectScopeAccessModifier</i> <i>PropertyName</i> : AssignmentExpression
    <i>ObjectScopeAccessModifier</i> <i>MethodDefinition</i>
  <i>VariableDeclaration</i>

    <i>BindingPattern</i> <i>Initializer</i>
    <b>static</b> <i>BindingIdentifier</i> <i>Initializer</i><sub>opt</sub>
    <b>static</b> <i>BindingPattern</i> <i>Initializer</i>
    <i>FunctionScopeAccessModifier</i> <b>static</b> <i>BindingIdentifier</i> <i>Initializer</i><sub>opt</sub>
    <i>FunctionScopeAccessModifier</i> <b>static</b> <i>BindingPattern</i> <i>Initializer</i>
</pre>

In essense, this proposal intends to allow:
* field declarations in `class` definitions,
* access modifiers in any object or class declaration
* access modifiers + `static` for any function-scoped `var` declaration

```js
class Example {
  private privField1 = "value";
  protected static protStaticField2() {}
  field = "value"; //Note: public is default
}

var example2 = {
  private privField1: "value",
  protected protField2() {},
  field: "value" //Note: public is default
};

function ExampleFn() {
  static field = 1; //`private` is default
  protected static field2 = 2;
  public static field = 3; //`public` allows exposing static fields
  console.log(`last sum = ${ExampleFn#.field1++ + ExampleFn#.field2++}`);
  console.log(`new sum = ${ExampleFn#.field1 + ExampleFn#.field2}`);
}
```
This notation allows the function to maintain data that survives the collapse of its closure. Each invocation of such a function would then have access to the data stored in those static fields by a prior invocation. While this feature is at first glance somewhat similar to the functionality of a generator, it is in fact very different, and a necessary feature for ensuring that fully featured constructor functions can still be generated without the help of the `class` keyword. See the [**Implementation details...**](https://github.com/rdking/proposal-object-members/blob/master/README.md#implementation-details) section for more information. 

Access to such members can be made through the `#` operator with the owning `function` as the left parameter. Use of any access modifier keyword in this scope without the `static` keyword for a given variable declaration results in a `SyntaxError`. Since a closure is an inherently private space, the `private` keyword is not required when declaring a `private static` field. However, because this would leave no means of declaring a `public static` field, this becomes the one and only use case where `public` serves a function.

Use of a single access modifier will not conflict with any other function modifiers. The `private` and `protected` keywords are meant to provide a access level to any and all possible forms of member variable, property, and function declaration that make sense within an object. Given the arguments that have led to [proposal-class-fields](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields), I propose that the access notation for both `private` and `protected` members be like this:

```javascript
class Example {
  private privField1 = "value";
  
  constructor() {
    console.log(`privField1 = ${this#.privField1}`);
  }
  
  static print(obj) {
    console.log(`privField1 = ${obj#["privField1"]}`);
  }
}
```

## How's this supposed to work?
#### The private member container access operator(`#`)
Other than the familiar declaration keywords, the only new thing is the `#`. As much as I hate to admit it, because of the comparatively peculiar way objects can be used in ES, to keep `private` members from being leaked, there must be a barrier between `public` members and `private` members. To this end, `#` will be a binary operator. The left term for this operator is the object from which we want to retrieve a `private` member. I didn't say "`private` or `protected` member" because `protected` members are just shared `private` members. More on that later. 

The right term for the `#` operator **must be an access operator**. This is critical. At no point, and under no circumstances is the `#` operator ever allowed to be used as a unary postfix operator. Allowing this would invite both confusion and private scope leaks. Violating this is a `SyntaxError`. The only other rule is that the `#` operator cannot be used outside of an object or `class` declaration. Violating this rule is also a `SyntaxError`. This also means that it is a SyntaxError to put `private` fields on an object declaration without also declaring at least 1 function in that declaration that accesses it.

In general, the rule for the `#` operator looks like this:

`<lParam>#<rParam> === <lParam>.[[PrivateValues]][<lParam>.[[DeclarationInfo]]<rParam>]`

Given code like `obj#.field`, ES should perform the following steps:
1. Throw a type error if `obj` is not an object
2. Let D be the `[[DeclarationInfo]]` record of `obj`.
3. If D is not and is not in the `[[DeclarationInfo]]` of the current function object, throw a TypeError.
4. Let N be the value for the key matching `field` in D, or undefined if no such key exists.
5. Let P be the `[[PrivateValues]]` record of `obj`.
6. If N is not a key of P, Throw a TypeError.
7. Return P[N].

See [**Implementation details...**](https://github.com/rdking/proposal-object-members/blob/master/README.md#implementation-details) for an explanation of the terms between the double braces (`[[ ]]`).

#### The `private` keyword
The `private` keyword declares members in much the same way as you would expect if you were implementing `private` data using a `WeakMap`. The `private` keyword will provide a simple means of implementing a "hard-private" interface. Nothing outside the declaring object will ever have access to any member declared `private` unless the declaring object provides for such. 

#### The `protected` keyword
The `protected` keyword declares members that are "soft-private" so as to allow them to be shared with inheriting objects. Because of the "soft-privacy" of `protected`, **_nothing declared as such should be considered as private information_**. What `protected` offers is API separation. By declaring fields as `protected` those fields will not appear as own properties of the object. Instead, they will appear as shared members of the object's `private` interface. In this way, methods declared in both the declaring object and other objects using the declaring object as a prototype will be able to access these members.

The examples below should make the usage of both `private` and `protected` clear.

With this proposal's syntax:
```javascript
class Example {
  private field1 = 'alpha';
  static private field2 = 0;
  protected field3 = '42';
  static protected field4 = "You can see me!";
  
  print() {
    console.log(`field1 = ${this#.field1}`);
    console.log(`field2 = ${this.constructor#.field2}`);
    console.log(`field3 = ${this#['field3']}`); //Yes, obj#.x === obj#['x']
    console.log(`field4 = ${this.constructor#.field4}`);
  }
}
```

Loosely Translated to ES6:
```javascript
//See the POC folder for details on this library
var Privacy = require("privacy.es6");

let Example = Privacy(class Example {
  static Privacy[DATA]() {
    return {
      ['private field1']: 'alpha',
      ['static private field2']: 0,
      ['protected field3']: '42',
      ['static protected field4']: "You can see me!"
    };
  }
  
  print() {
    console.log(`field1 = ${this['#'].field1}`);
    console.log(`field2 = ${this.constructor['#'].field2}`);
    console.log(`field3 = ${this['#']['field3']}`); //Yes, obj#.x === obj#['x']
    console.log(`field4 = ${this.constructor['#'].field4}`);
  }
})
```

If we were to inherit from the example above:
```javascript
class SubExample extends Example {
  private field5 = "Hello from the SubExample!";
  
  constructor() {
    super();
  }
  
  print() {
    super.print();
    console.log(`field5 = ${this#.field5}`);
  }
}
```
it might roughly translate to the following:
```javascript
let SubExample = Privacy(class SubExample extends Example {
  static Privacy[DATA]() {
    return {
        ['private field5']: "Hello from the SubExample!"
      };
    }
  
  constructor() {
    super();
  }
  
  print() {
    super.print();
    console.log(`field5 = ${this['#'].field5}`);
  }
});
```

## Privileges for object declarations...
Both `private` and `protected` will be supported for object declarations. This allows object factories to also make use of non-public data and API without the risk of memory leaks often inherent in closure-based APIs. Inheritance via setting the `__proto__` of an object will cause the instance to inherit the protected members of the parent object.

## Mutations to objects...
Any function added to an object literal or a `class` prototype after the declaration will not have access to the `private` and `protected` members of the object literal or `class`. The reason for this can be seen by looking at the translated code in [**The `private` and `protected` keywords...**](https://github.com/rdking/proposal-object-members/blob/master/README.md#the-private-and-protected-keywords) section above. The result of a `private` or `protected` declaration is a `Symbol` that only exists within the scope of the corresponding object literal or `class` declaration. Functions declared later will not have access to these `Symbols`. Also, since these `Symbols` are not themselves part of the object literal or `class` declaration, there is no means of retrieving these `Symbols` via any object literal, `class` constructor, or `class` prototype.

## Implementation details...
Every object will contain 3 new slots: 
* one for `private` values (`[[PrivateValues]]`)
* one for declaration info (`[[DeclarationInfo]]`)
* one for inheritance info (`[[InheritanceInfo]]`)

`[[PrivateValues]]` will contain a single record, the key/value pairs of which will be the private `Symbol` name and associated data for all of the `private` and `protected` fields as well as a `__proto__: null` pair. `[[PrivateValues]]` serves as the storage record for all `private` and `protected` data. Each member will be added as non-configurable. The `__proto__` will be set to the `[[PrivateValues]]` of the parent object after all `private` and `protected` declarations have been added.

`[[DeclarationInfo]]` will contain an array of records. The 1<sup>st</sup> of these records describes the private fields of the associated object. Each of the remaining records come from other object for which the current object has been granted access. Each `[[DeclarationInfo]]` object will have key/value pairs which will be the declared `[[Identifier Name]]` and corresponding private `Symbol` value of each `private` and `protected` member as well as a `__proto__: null` pair. Each record of the  `[[DeclarationInfo]]` array serves as a list of known `private` and `protected` fields that are valid given a particular scope and context pair. Each member of the 1<sup>st</sup> `[[DeclarationInfo]]` record will be added as non-configurable and read-only. The `__proto__` of the 1<sup>st</sup> record of the `[[DeclarationInfo]]` array will be set to the `[[InheritanceInfo]]` of the parent object after all `private` and `protected` declarations have been added.

`[[InheritanceInfo]]` will contain a single record, the key/value pairs of which are the declared `[[Identifier Name]]` and corresponding `Symbol` value of the `protected` members of the object as well as a `__proto__: null` pair. `[[InheritanceInfo]]` serves as the list of inheritable names. Each member will be added as non-configurable and read-only.  The `__proto__` will be set to the `[[InheritanceInfo]]` of the parent object after all `private` and `protected` declarations have been added.

Declaring an object within a given scope results in that object acquiring all `[[DeclarationInfo]]` records accessible via the containing scope. This **does not** include the `[[DeclarationInfo]]` records of other objects contained within the same scope. In this way, the object gains access to all private information accessible from the same scope. 

Access checks are performed by searching for matching records in the `[[DeclarationInfo]]` arrays of the targeted object and requesting function. If a match is found and the match contains the requested `[[IdentifierName]]`, access is granted. If no matching record is found, or if the requested `[[IdentifierName]]` is not found in any of the matching records, then a TypeError is thrown.

When using the `class` keyword to create an object factory, all non-`static` members that are declared either `private` or `protected` are applied to the prototype. Members that are declared both `static` and either `private` or `protected` are treated as though they are `static` members of the function's own lexical scope. This allows such members to be applied to the afore mentioned slots of the function object itself.

## The odd bits...
There will be those who strongly disagree with the use of the `private` keyword without access notation that looks like `obj.field`. As long as it is understood that much like implementation of private data via a WeakMap, there is a separate private container only accessible using the `#` operator from within a method declared on the object, then access notation does indeed "look like" `obj.field` since `obj#` is the actual object being accessed.

## The gotchas...
Because `obj#;` is a `SyntaxError`, there's no way to directly get at the private container. As such, the following things just won't work over private members:

* Destructuring 
* Iteration
* Anything else that would require direct access to the private container
