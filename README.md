# Object members proposal

There are actually 2 different proposals here. Both are for implementing privilege levels on object members. The difference between the two is that [one of them](./README_WITH_SIGIL.md) offers undetectability for private fields while [the other](./README_WITHOUT_SIGIL.md) offers a syntax more in line with the expectations of developers. Barring this difference, the 2 proposals are identical.
