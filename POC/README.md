# Object members proposal - P.O.C.

The purpose of this folder is to provide an ES6 compatible proof of concept for proposal-object-members. The code required to implement the portion of this proposal that could viably be done is in "privacy.es6.js". The file "example.js" contains the example logic that was used to test the initial viability. The "tests" folder contains contains jest-jasmine2 tests, fully verifying that the desired capabilities and hindrances of this proposal have been upheld for object declarations with and without constructors as well as class constructed objects.
