Testing basic classes...                                                       example.js:3
field1 = alpha                                                                 example.js:23
field2 = 0                                                                     example.js:24
field3 = 42                                                                    example.js:25
field4 = You can see me!                                                       example.js:26
                                                                               example.js:35
Testing subclasses...
According to the superclass...                                                 example.js:54
field1 = alpha                                                                 example.js:23
field2 = 0                                                                     example.js:24
field3 = 21                                                                    example.js:25
field4 = You can see me!                                                       example.js:26
According to the subclass...                                                   example.js:56
Non-interferring masking is possible as well.                                  example.js:42
The old "field3" is still '42'!                                                example.js:43
test2.yes = You can always see me!                                             example.js:63
SubExample.no = undefined                                                      example.js:64
                                                                               example.js:66
Testing objects...
field1 = signs point to yes                                                    example.js:72
field2 = seems likely                                                          example.js:73
field3 = absolutely                                                            example.js:74
                                                                               example.js:80
Testing object inheritance...
I should be able to see field 2 from here...                                   example.js:85
field1 = new and improved                                                      example.js:87
field2 = seems likely... not!                                                  example.js:88
field3 = absolutely                                                            example.js:89
And the old stuff is still there too!                                          example.js:90
field1 = signs point to yes                                                    example.js:72
field2 = seems likely... not!                                                  example.js:73
field3 = absolutely                                                            example.js:74
